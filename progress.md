## Entry 000 — Project memory initialized

Date/time:       <fill when repository is initialized>
Git branch:      <exact branch>
Commit:          <short hash if available>
Author/Agent:    <name/agent>
Workstream:      docs
Change:          Added development-memory framework
Files/modules:   AGENT.md, flow.md, progress.md, technical-questions.md, decisions.md

### What Changed

Created the project memory files used by human developers and AI agents.

### Reason

Preserve current architecture, historical changes, unresolved questions, decisions and evidence throughout implementation.

### Technical Impact

No runtime behavior changed.

### Validation

Confirmed the files exist and are readable.

### Evidence

Repository files.

### Result

SUCCESS

### Problems / Limitations

Runtime implementation has not been recorded yet.

### Next Step

Begin Phase 0 Razorpay Test Mode provider spike.

## Entry 001 — Parallel workstream documentation created

Date/time:       2026-09-04 (Asia/Calcutta)
Git branch:      main
Commit:          951ba00
Author/Agent:    Codex architecture/documentation agent
Workstream:      docs
Change:          Added master execution plan, seven bounded workstream briefs and aligned canonical interface contracts
Files/modules:   AGENT.md, decisions.md, progress.md, technical-questions.md, docs/MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, docs/workstreams/, docs/README.md, docs/DOCS_INDEX.md, docs/EVALUATION.md, docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, docs/API.md, docs/DATA_MODEL.md, docs/TESTED.md

### What Changed

Created a contract-first execution system for three parallel coding lanes. Corrected existing MCP-first wording so the reference buyer chat is consistently the primary guaranteed demo and MCP is a separate interoperability adapter. Added the bounded `ProductImage` and storage contracts required by the plan.

### Reason

Reduce agent reading scope, prevent overlapping ownership and preserve the single financial authority during parallel implementation.

### Technical Impact

Documentation/contracts only. No runtime code or implemented system state changed.

### Validation

Checked document links, required workstream headings, transaction-state terminology, scenario ledger counts and buyer-chat/MCP wording. No runtime tests were run because no runtime implementation exists.

### Evidence

Repository diff and documentation validation commands on branch `main`.

### Result

SUCCESS

### Problems / Limitations

Razorpay success evidence, image URL policy and MCP idempotency-key derivation remain open. All runtime scenarios remain `NOT RUN`.

### Next Step

Freeze M0 shared contracts, then start the provider truth spike and three bounded implementation lanes.

## Entry 002 — Milestone 0 foundation implemented

Date/time:       2026-09-04 (Asia/Calcutta)
Git branch:      main
Commit:          951ba00
Author/Agent:    Codex
Workstream:      06-data-infrastructure / shared contracts
Change:          Implemented repository layout, database connection, migration framework, canonical schemas, contracts, interfaces, errors, tests and environment template
Files/modules:   pyproject.toml, uv.lock, .env.example, docker-compose.yml, alembic.ini, migrations/, src/ai_commerce_gateway/, tests/, docs/DEVELOPMENT.md, flow.md

### What Changed

Created the typed Python modular-monolith foundation. Added all 15 canonical SQLAlchemy tables and initial Alembic migration; frozen Pydantic DTOs and Protocol ports; stable application/validation error envelopes; opaque ID generation; FastAPI liveness/readiness; environment and PostgreSQL templates; and unit, contract and integration test layers.

Moved the previously created workstream briefs into the required `docs/workstreams/` location.

### Reason

Satisfy Milestone 0 and provide safe seams for the three implementation lanes before feature work begins.

### Technical Impact

Foundation only. No merchant, catalog, transaction, Razorpay, buyer-chat or MCP feature behavior was implemented.

### Validation

`uv run ruff check .` passed. `uv run mypy` passed. `uv run pytest --cov=ai_commerce_gateway --cov-report=term-missing` passed 13 tests with 97% package coverage; one live PostgreSQL connection test skipped because `TEST_DATABASE_URL` was not configured. Alembic upgrade/downgrade passed against a temporary database, and offline PostgreSQL migration SQL generation succeeded.

### Evidence

Local command output on branch `main`; migration revision `2a8a78d61842`.

### Result

SUCCESS WITH EXTERNAL-DB CHECK NOT RUN

### Problems / Limitations

No PostgreSQL service was available for a live connection test. Existing Razorpay, storage URL and MCP idempotency questions remain unresolved.

### Next Step

Run the provider-truth spike or begin the bounded Milestone 1 merchant/catalog lane using the frozen contracts.

## Entry 003 — Milestone 0 frozen and buyer-path documentation normalized

Date/time:       2026-09-04 (Asia/Calcutta)
Git branch:      main
Commit:          9c32855
Author/Agent:    Codex
Workstream:      docs / foundation review
Change:          Recorded the successful PostgreSQL gate and removed residual MCP-first ambiguity
Files/modules:   AGENT.md, flow.md, progress.md, docs/PRD.md, docs/EVALUATION.md, docs/MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, docs/TESTED.md

### What Changed

Recorded successful GitHub Actions run `33817667540` for M0 commit `1640869` and the resulting
`m0-foundation` freeze. Clarified that Reference Buyer Chat is the primary buyer journey and that
Remote MCP is a separate interoperability proof over the same application services.

### Reason

Prevent future development agents from interpreting older combined buyer/MCP wording as an
MCP-first product or demo architecture.

### Technical Impact

Documentation only. No implementation, contracts, schema or runtime behavior changed.

### Validation

Searched canonical and living documentation for MCP-first buyer/demo language and reviewed the
resulting documentation diff. Remaining MCP-first phrases are explicit prohibitions or non-goals.

### Evidence

GitHub Actions run `33817667540`; tag `m0-foundation`; repository documentation diff.

### Result

SUCCESS

### Problems / Limitations

Provider behavior and the exact mutating-MCP idempotency strategy remain intentionally provisional.

### Next Step

Start feature work only within the frozen workstream boundaries.

## Entry 004 — Gated child-phase execution model documented

Date/time:       2026-09-04 (Asia/Calcutta)
Git branch:      main
Commit:          commit containing this entry
Author/Agent:    Codex
Workstream:      docs / execution governance
Change:          Split three long-lived lanes into bounded A/B/C child phases with hard review gates
Files/modules:   AGENT.md, decisions.md, progress.md, docs/PHASE_EXECUTION.md, docs/DOCS_INDEX.md, docs/MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, docs/workstreams/*/WORKSTREAM.md

### What Changed

Defined the existing `feature/*` branches as long-lived ownership lanes and added A1–A6, B1–B6 and
C1–C6 child phases. Added phase statuses, branch direction, required prompt shape, risk-specific
tests, self-review, independent audit, human approval and a reusable evidence record. Updated every
workstream with its phase ownership or integration role.

### Reason

Prevent large agent runs from erasing review boundaries and make rollback, debugging and evidence
attribution practical without giving up three-lane parallelism.

### Technical Impact

Documentation and development process only. No runtime implementation, frozen contract, schema or
branch reference changed.

### Validation

Cross-checked phase IDs, branch names, workstream ownership, testing responsibility, integration
direction and Reference Buyer Chat/MCP boundaries across canonical and living documentation.

### Evidence

Repository documentation diff and relationship search.

### Result

SUCCESS

### Problems / Limitations

No phase branches were created. Human approval is still required before starting the first phase in
each lane.

### Next Step

Choose the first active phase per lane and create only those three child branches from their current
lane heads.

## Entry 005 — Phase C1 Buyer Application Adapter Implemented

Date/time:       2026-09-04 (Asia/Calcutta)
Git branch:      feature/buyer-agent
Commit:          PENDING
Author/Agent:    Antigravity
Workstream:      05-buyer-ai-mcp
Change:          Implemented BuyerAdapter over M0 application-service contracts
Files/modules:   src/ai_commerce_gateway/application/buyer_adapter/

### What Changed

Implemented the thin buyer-side application/tool adapter foundation. Created narrow typed buyer-facing request/response schemas, safe error mapping, tools schemas, and contract tests using fakes.

### Reason

Satisfy Phase C1 requirements to prepare for C2 Reference Buyer Chat.

### Technical Impact

No direct provider calls or financial logic. Idempotency key and correlation ID propagation is supported via an InvocationContext.

### Validation

Passed ruff, mypy, and pytest with 94% coverage.

### Evidence

Repository files.

### Result

SUCCESS

### Problems / Limitations

None.

### Next Step

Phase C2.
