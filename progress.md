## Entry 000 — Project memory initialized

Date/time:       <fill when repository is initialized>
Git branch:      <exact branch>
Commit:          <short hash if available>
Author/Agent:    <name/agent>
Workstream:      docs
Change:          Added development-memory framework
Files/modules:   AGENT.md, flow.md, progress.md, technical-questions.md, decisions.md

### What Changed

Created the project memory files used by human developers and AI agents.

### Reason

Preserve current architecture, historical changes, unresolved questions, decisions and evidence throughout implementation.

### Technical Impact

No runtime behavior changed.

### Validation

Confirmed the files exist and are readable.

### Evidence

Repository files.

### Result

SUCCESS

### Problems / Limitations

Runtime implementation has not been recorded yet.

### Next Step

Begin Phase 0 Razorpay Test Mode provider spike.

## Entry 001 — Parallel workstream documentation created

Date/time:       2026-09-04 (Asia/Calcutta)
Git branch:      main
Commit:          951ba00
Author/Agent:    Codex architecture/documentation agent
Workstream:      docs
Change:          Added master execution plan, seven bounded workstream briefs and aligned canonical interface contracts
Files/modules:   AGENT.md, decisions.md, progress.md, technical-questions.md, docs/MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, docs/workstreams/, docs/README.md, docs/DOCS_INDEX.md, docs/EVALUATION.md, docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, docs/API.md, docs/DATA_MODEL.md, docs/TESTED.md

### What Changed

Created a contract-first execution system for three parallel coding lanes. Corrected existing MCP-first wording so the reference buyer chat is consistently the primary guaranteed demo and MCP is a separate interoperability adapter. Added the bounded `ProductImage` and storage contracts required by the plan.

### Reason

Reduce agent reading scope, prevent overlapping ownership and preserve the single financial authority during parallel implementation.

### Technical Impact

Documentation/contracts only. No runtime code or implemented system state changed.

### Validation

Checked document links, required workstream headings, transaction-state terminology, scenario ledger counts and buyer-chat/MCP wording. No runtime tests were run because no runtime implementation exists.

### Evidence

Repository diff and documentation validation commands on branch `main`.

### Result

SUCCESS

### Problems / Limitations

Razorpay success evidence, image URL policy and MCP idempotency-key derivation remain open. All runtime scenarios remain `NOT RUN`.

### Next Step

Freeze M0 shared contracts, then start the provider truth spike and three bounded implementation lanes.

## Entry 002 — Milestone 0 foundation implemented

Date/time:       2026-09-04 (Asia/Calcutta)
Git branch:      main
Commit:          951ba00
Author/Agent:    Codex
Workstream:      06-data-infrastructure / shared contracts
Change:          Implemented repository layout, database connection, migration framework, canonical schemas, contracts, interfaces, errors, tests and environment template
Files/modules:   pyproject.toml, uv.lock, .env.example, docker-compose.yml, alembic.ini, migrations/, src/ai_commerce_gateway/, tests/, docs/DEVELOPMENT.md, flow.md

### What Changed

Created the typed Python modular-monolith foundation. Added all 15 canonical SQLAlchemy tables and initial Alembic migration; frozen Pydantic DTOs and Protocol ports; stable application/validation error envelopes; opaque ID generation; FastAPI liveness/readiness; environment and PostgreSQL templates; and unit, contract and integration test layers.

Moved the previously created workstream briefs into the required `docs/workstreams/` location.

### Reason

Satisfy Milestone 0 and provide safe seams for the three implementation lanes before feature work begins.

### Technical Impact

Foundation only. No merchant, catalog, transaction, Razorpay, buyer-chat or MCP feature behavior was implemented.

### Validation

`uv run ruff check .` passed. `uv run mypy` passed. `uv run pytest --cov=ai_commerce_gateway --cov-report=term-missing` passed 13 tests with 97% package coverage; one live PostgreSQL connection test skipped because `TEST_DATABASE_URL` was not configured. Alembic upgrade/downgrade passed against a temporary database, and offline PostgreSQL migration SQL generation succeeded.

### Evidence

Local command output on branch `main`; migration revision `2a8a78d61842`.

### Result

SUCCESS WITH EXTERNAL-DB CHECK NOT RUN

### Problems / Limitations

No PostgreSQL service was available for a live connection test. Existing Razorpay, storage URL and MCP idempotency questions remain unresolved.

### Next Step

Run the provider-truth spike or begin the bounded Milestone 1 merchant/catalog lane using the frozen contracts.
