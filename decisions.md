# decisions.md — Architectural and Product Decisions

Record durable decisions that future developers and AI agents must understand.

## D-001 — Target only the AI-buyer branch of Razorpay Track 1

Status: ACTIVE
Date: <fill>
Branch: <fill>
Owner: Project team

### Decision

V1 focuses on making a merchant transactable by an AI buyer end to end.

Revenue campaigns, upsell/cross-sell engines and campaign orchestration are outside v1.

### Why

The Track 1 prompt uses an OR condition. Narrowing scope allows deeper execution and stronger evidence.

### Alternatives Considered

- Build both merchant growth and AI-buyer transaction flows.
- Build a revenue-growth-only project.

### Consequences

Architecture prioritizes merchant publication, MCP access, transaction authority, Razorpay Test Mode, audit and recovery.

### Evidence / Trigger

Project scope review.

### Supersedes

None.

## D-002 — MCP is an adapter, not the payment authority

Status: ACTIVE
Date: <fill>
Branch: <fill>
Owner: Project team

### Decision

MCP tools call the same application services as HTTP/dashboard flows.

### Why

Financial rules must remain deterministic and centralized.

### Alternatives Considered

- Put business logic directly in MCP tools.

### Consequences

The MCP layer remains thin. Authorization, money, policy, transaction state and Razorpay calls remain in backend services.

### Evidence / Trigger

Architecture review.

### Supersedes

None.

## D-003 — Keep buyer consent and merchant acceptance as separate gates

Status: ACTIVE
Date: <fill>
Branch: <fill>
Owner: Project team

### Decision

Buyer authorization and merchant policy/manual acceptance are independent.

### Why

They answer different questions: whether the buyer may spend and whether the merchant accepts the order.

### Alternatives Considered

- One generic approval state.

### Consequences

Data model, state machine, audit and UI must preserve both decisions independently.

### Evidence / Trigger

Security and product review.

### Supersedes

None.
